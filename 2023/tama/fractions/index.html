<p>Let the apple emoji üçé be <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the banana emoji üçå be <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and the coconut emoji ü•• be <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, note that floating point is the devil. So, as one normally does with rational functions, let‚Äôs multiply through both sides by a common denominator and move everything to one side.</p>
<p>To be a bit less cluttered, let <span class="math inline">\(s = x + 2z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t = 2x - y + 3z\)</span>. Then, we should get: <span class="math display">\[
    \frac{2syt + 2xyt - 3xst - xsy}{xsyt} = 0.
\]</span> And again, as is typical for rational functions, we know that the entire expression equals <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(2syt + 2xyt - 3xst - xsy = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s \neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t \neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>This can all be done using integer arithmetic! Perfect!</p>
<p>A simple brute force solution is to enumerate <strong>all</strong> tuples of <span class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(-n \leq x, y, z \leq n\)</span> (say, using three nested for loops) and count the number of tuples for which the above criteria hold. The total amount of work is proportional to <span class="math inline">\((2n+1)^3\)</span>, the number of tested tuples, and with <span class="math inline">\(n=3^5 = 243\)</span>, this approach is fast enough for the first subtask.</p>
<p></details></p>
<p><details class="editorial-section"><summary class="h2">Subtask 2</summary></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs write the numerator entirely in terms of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[
    2(x+2z)y(2x - y + 3z) + 2xy(2x - y + 3z) - 2x(x+2z)(2x - y + 3z) - 2x(x+2z)y = 0.
\]</span> If we expand this out and collect like terms, we should get an equation that looks something like this: <span class="math display">\[
    Ax^3 + Bx^2y + Cxy^2 + Dy^2z + Eyz^2 + Fx^2z + Gxz^2 + Hxyz = 0,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\)</span> are some constants whose values I won‚Äôt spell out here (you can do the algebra on pen-and-paper or using a computer algebra system to get these coefficients yourself).</p>
<p>However, note that once <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are selected, then our choices for <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù; when only <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is left to vary, we are left with a one-variable equation, which we know how to solve! In particular: <span class="math display">\[
    (Ey + Gx)z^2 + (Dy^2 + Fx^2 + Hxy)z + (Ax^3 + Bx^2y + Cxy^2) = 0.
\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are fixed, then this just becomes a quadratic equation in terms of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, and we know how to solve those! So, precisely, we get the following solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enumerate all pairs <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(-n \leq x, y \leq n\)</span>. For each one:
<ul>
<li>Use the quadratic formula to solve for what values of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> satisfy the equation.</li>
<li>For each distinct solution of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that (a) is an integer; and (b) lies within <span class="math inline">\(-n\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, add <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> to the answer.
<ul>
<li>Remember also to not count solutions which would make any of the denominators equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You also have to handle some other edge cases, such as what to do if <span class="math inline">\(Ey + Gx = 0\)</span>, but those are implementation details you can figure out yourself. The amount of work done is now only proportional to <span class="math inline">\((2n+1)^2\)</span> (since we only enumerate all possible <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>). With <span class="math inline">\(n = 5^5 = 3125\)</span>, this approach is fast enough for the second subtask.</p>
<p></details></p>
<p><details class="editorial-section"><summary class="h2">Subtask 3</summary></p>
<p>The previous algorithm is too slow for subtasks 3 and 4. This is because the amount of work grows quadratically with respect to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and for <span class="math inline">\(n = 5^{10} = 9765625\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\((2n+1)^2 \approx 4\cdot 10^{14}\)</span>, which is quite large; a computer that can do <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> billion operations per second (a.k.a. ‚Äú1 gigahertz‚Äù) will take several days to solve this problem with the previous algorithm.</p>
<p>Anyway, for this subtask, we will just give you hints on how to proceed. But for these hints to be helpful, you probably should first know how to solve degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> Diophantine equations. (The current equation is of degree <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.) There are plenty of those you can practice on in Project Euler.</p>
<div class="task">
<p><strong>Hint 1:</strong> If <span class="math inline">\((x, y, z)\)</span> is an integer solution, then <span class="math inline">\((n x, n y, n z)\)</span> is also an integer solution for any integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. In fact, <span class="math inline">\((\alpha x, \alpha y, \alpha z)\)</span> is a <em>rational</em> solution for any rational <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>(Basically, ‚Äú<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <em>homogeneous</em>.‚Äù)</p>
<p>If you think about this some more, it means that if we write our equation as <span class="math display">\[f(x, y, z) = 0,\]</span> then integer solutions to this are related to rational solutions of <span class="math display">\[f(X, Y, 1) = 0.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="task">
<p><strong>Hint 2:</strong> Because <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is homogeneous of degree <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(X, Y, 1) = 0\)</span> is a cubic curve, which renders the corresponding rational equation hard to solve. (We can generally solve up to degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> easily, but degree <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is where dragons<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> roam.)</p>
<p>However, if you actually draw/plot the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(X, Y, 1) = 0\)</span>, you should see <em>something curious</em>...</p>
