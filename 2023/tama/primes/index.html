<h3 id="brute-force">Brute force?</h3>
<p>The input in the first subtask is small enough that <strong>brute force</strong> may be feasible.</p>
<p>One straightforward idea for a brute force solution would be to enumerate all possible sequences of numbers from <span class="math inline">\(\{2, 3, \ldots, b-1\}\)</span>, and for each one, compute the corresponding Mini-sequences and Maxi-sequences and check whether the conditions <span class="math inline">\(m_1 &lt; m_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; m_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_1 &lt; M_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; M_n\)</span> are satisfied.</p>
<p>Now, to compute the <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span>, we need to factorize the numbers. Since the numbers are only up to <span class="math inline">\(47\)</span>, we can simply do this by brute force as well (and save the results).</p>
<p>Here’s one possible way to implement it: <details class="code"><summary class="h4">Code (Python)</summary></p>

<p></details> Here, we used backtracking to enumerate all sequences of numbers of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b-1\)</span>. You can also just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product"><code>itertools.product</code></a> to enumerate them more simply—it’s just <code class="sourceCode python">product(<span class="bu">range</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, b), repeat<span class="op">=</span>n)</code>:</p>

        ...</code></pre></div>
<p>We can check that this is correct by running it on one of the examples, say <span class="math inline">\(n = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = 18\)</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you try to pass in the actual input <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = 48\)</span>, you’ll find that it doesn’t seem to finish. Indeed, there are <span class="math inline">\(46\)</span> possible values, which means there are <span class="math inline">\(46^{10} \approx 4\cdot 10^{16}\)</span> possible sequences. Even if we could process <span class="math inline">\(10^9\)</span> sequences per second, this program will take more than one year to finish!</p>
<p>We can improve this slightly with some observations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, the numbers must be <em>distinct</em>, so we could just enumerate all sequences <strong>without repeated values</strong>. This reduces the number of candidates from <span class="math inline">\(46^{10}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(46\cdot 45\cdot 44 \cdots 37\)</span>. However, this number is still large—it’s <span class="math inline">\(\approx 1.5\cdot 10^{16}\)</span>, which isn’t a huge improvement. With <span class="math inline">\(10^9\)</span> sequences per second, our program would still take several months.</p></li>
<li><p>Another insight would be to notice that for every set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct numbers, there is at most one ordering of them that could potentially work, because we want their largest (or smallest) prime factors to be increasing as well. So for every <em>set</em> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct numbers, we can simply <strong>sort them by their largest prime factor</strong>, and check if that ordering works. This reduces the number of candidates further to <span class="math inline">\(\binom{46}{10} \approx 4\cdot 10^9\)</span>, which is much smaller than before, and the program may now be waitable.</p></li>
<li><p>However, we can do even better than this. We could attempt to build the sequence number by number, and stop the construction <strong>as soon as one of the conditions already fails</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the goal is to construct the sequence <span class="math inline">\([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\)</span> number by number. At every point in the construction, we’re attempting to choose the value of some <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b-1\)</span>. We could just try each of them in turn, but we could do better: We know that <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>’s smallest and largest prime factors must be larger than those of <span class="math inline">\(a_{i-1}\)</span>’s, so it’s enough to only try the values with that property.</p>
<p>After successfully choosing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such numbers this way, we’re guaranteed that the sequence we produced is valid (since we already checked all the necessary conditions), so the running time of this solution is now basically proportional to the number of sequences itself!<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> So we simply hope that there aren’t too many of them that the program will finish quickly. And sure enough, if you implement and run this with <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = 48\)</span>, we find that it finishes in just a few seconds, even in Python!</p></li>

<h3 id="pen-and-paper">Pen and paper?</h3>
<p>You could also solve this subtask with pen and paper by using the solution for Subtask 2, which is perfectly doable by hand.</p>
<p></details></p>
<p><details class="editorial-section"><summary class="h2">Subtask 2</summary></p>
<h3 id="visualizing-the-problem">Visualizing the problem</h3>
<p>A fairly general advice I commonly give to people is to <strong>draw a lot</strong>.</p>
<p>For many problems that are clearly visual (such as geometry problems), this is obvious, but this advice still applies even to problems that aren’t explicitly visual/geometrical, such as this problem.</p>
<p>Now, strictly speaking this isn’t always needed, but in my experience, visualizing the problem has several benefits. For example, I find that visualizing often makes things easier to think about (since you can “see” the problem, and to an extent, it’s “more tangible”). Also, I find that in many cases, it makes some insights easier to see. (We will see an example of this later on.) Humans have innate powerful spatial skills, and we should take advantage of that.</p>
<p>So how do we make this problem geometric? Well, after thinking about it a bit, it becomes clear that the numbers between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> don’t really matter as much as their smallest and largest prime factors. Thus, rather than looking at the numbers <span class="math inline">\(2, 3, \ldots, b-1\)</span>, we could say we’re looking at the 2D <strong>points</strong> <span class="math inline">\((x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), \ldots, (x_{b-1}, y_{b-1})\)</span>, where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is the largest prime factor of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is the smallest prime factor of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can now rephrase the problem as follows. Recall that we want to find the number of sequences <span class="math inline">\((i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n)\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x_{i_1} &lt; x_{i_2} &lt; \ldots &lt; x_{i_n}\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y_{i_1} &lt; y_{i_2} &lt; \ldots &lt; y_{i_n}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, “<span class="math inline">\(x &lt; x&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y &lt; y&#39;\)</span>” is the same as saying that “point <span class="math inline">\((x&#39;, y&#39;)\)</span> is located northeast of point <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span>.” Thus, what we’re really counting is the number of sequences of such points that are “going northeast”.</p>
<p><img class="illus" src="images/primes1.png" width="400px"/></p>
Here is now our problem, from a “geometrical” perspective:
<div class="task">
<p><strong>Problem (Restated)</strong>: Given a list of points <span class="math inline">\(\left[(x_i, y_i) \mid 1 &lt; i &lt; b \right]\)</span>, how many sequences of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such points are there that “go northeast”?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="counting-recursively">Counting recursively</h3>
<p>We’re looking for sequences of points of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that go northeast. A straightforward way to build a sequence is to choose the points one by one, and we need only make sure that every point we choose is northeast of the previous point.</p>
Well, the sequence has to start somewhere, so the first point must be any one of the <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>s, and we can write the answer as <span class="math display">\[\mathit{answer} = S(n, 2) + S(n, 3) + \ldots + S(n, b-1)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S(n, i)\)</span> is the number of sequences of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that start at the point <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>. Writing the above in summation notation, it’s the same as <span class="math display">\[\mathit{answer} = \sum_{i=2}^{b-1} S(n, i).\]</span> Let’s now figure out how to compute <span class="math inline">\(S(n, i)\)</span>. The first point is <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>, so the second point must be a point <span class="math inline">\((x_j, y_j)\)</span> northeast of <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span> (that is, “<span class="math inline">\(x_i &lt; x_j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_i &lt; y_j\)</span>”), so basically the remaining points form a valid sequence (of length <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span>) that starts at the point <span class="math inline">\((x_j, y_j)\)</span>. But we can count such sequences recursively—that’s just <span class="math inline">\(S(n-1, j)\)</span> by definition! Thus, since the next point can be <em>any</em> such point <span class="math inline">\((x_j, y_j)\)</span> northeast of <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>, we have the recurrence <span class="math display">\[S(n, i) = \sum_{\substack{j=2 \,\\ x_i &lt; x_j \\ y_i &lt; y_j}}^{b-1} S(n-1, j).\]</span> The base case should be simple:
<div class="task">
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Show that we can use the base case <span class="math inline">\(S(1, i) = 1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Using this recurrence, we can now build a table of values of <span class="math inline">\(S(n&#39;, i)\)</span>, for all <span class="math inline">\((n&#39;, i)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(1 \le n&#39; \le n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 &lt; i &lt; b\)</span>. We can build this table in increasing order of <span class="math inline">\(n&#39;\)</span>, because each entry <span class="math inline">\(S(n&#39;, i)\)</span> only depends on the “previous layer” (because the summands are <span class="math inline">\(S(n&#39; - 1, j)\)</span>), whose values we’ve already computed. Finally, once we fill in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th layer, we could then compute the answer using our summation formula above.</p>
<p>What’s the running time of this solution? Well, there are <span class="math inline">\(\approx nb\)</span> possible arguments <span class="math inline">\((n&#39;, i)\)</span>, and each one is computed with a summation with <span class="math inline">\(\approx b\)</span> terms, so the amount of work is roughly <span class="math inline">\(\approx nb\cdot b = nb^2\)</span>. (In algorithm parlance, we say that the running time is “<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}(nb^2)\)</span>.”) The amount of steps needed is small enough that this algorithm can be used to solve subtask 1 by hand (or maybe with a spreadsheet). For subtask 2, this is already quite waitable, but we can slightly speed it up by noticing that <span class="math inline">\(S(n, i)\)</span> doesn’t really depend on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, only on <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>, so such values are equal for multiple points that happen to <em>coincide</em>. Formally, if <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i) = (x_j, y_j)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(S(n, i) = S(n, j)\)</span>. Using this, we only need to compute it once for every <em>distinct</em> point in <span class="math inline">\(\{(x_i, y_i) \mid 1 &lt; i &lt; b \}\)</span>. This speeds up the running time from <span class="math inline">\(\approx nb\cdot b\)</span> steps to <span class="math inline">\(\approx np\cdot b\)</span> steps, where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the number of distinct points. (For <span class="math inline">\(b = 4000\)</span>, you could check that <span class="math inline">\(p = 1637\)</span>.)</p>
<p>This technique of building a table of results whose elements depend on earlier entries is called <strong>dynamic programming</strong>, or DP.</p>

<p>For the remaining subtasks, I’ll only give hints. The previous solution is now too slow, so we need something faster. I’ll give you a few hints that you can use to speed up your solution in different ways. A combination of some of them (plus maybe a few other insights) can be used to solve the remaining subtasks.</p>
<p><details class="task"><summary class="h4">Hint 1 (Factoring faster)</summary> There are faster ways to factorize all numbers up to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, e.g., by suitably modifying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">sieve of Eratosthenes</a>. </details></p>
<p><details class="task"><summary class="h4">Hint 2 (Summing faster)</summary> The <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th “layer” of the table (“layer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>”) can be computed based only off the previous layer (“layer <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>”). Now, each element <span class="math inline">\(S(n, i)\)</span> of the current layer is obtained from the previous layer as the sum across “all points northeast of <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span>”. Graphically, if we write the numbers <span class="math inline">\(S(n-1, i)\)</span> on their locations <span class="math inline">\((x_i, y_i)\)</span> in the 2D plane, then we’re summing up a “quadrant”, e.g.,</p>

<p>It turns out that there are data structures that can speed this up! Such data structures preprocess a bunch of data like this so that after preprocessing, you can evaluate such “range sums” much more quickly than brute force. These cool <strong>tree-based</strong> data structures are fairly standard, and there are publicly available training materials discussing them, such as these training modules written by NOI.PH: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZKVE8an5zEhyd3YYolK4BoQViawqEj9m/view?usp=drive_link">Trees</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hIirDnD-C--RVX7c8d6B6ScHcBbRb5ro/view?usp=drive_link">DS1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15q2WWAg2I1n5-MqHMKLm7BR7P4oYQZ-x/view?usp=drive_link">DS2</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17zd_VzBMJ0tfHue1tGAh5Qo4jpXNPPQJ/view?usp=drive_link">DS3</a>. </details></p>
<p><details class="task"><summary class="h4">Hint 3 (More insight on the data)</summary> Our images above are just showing a bunch of random points for illustration purposes, but that may be misleading. Are our points <em>really</em> random? Try plotting the points <span class="math inline">\(\left[(x_i, y_i) \mid 1 &lt; i &lt; b\right]\)</span> and see... </details></p>
<p>The last two hints are the reason why I asked you to <em>visualize</em> the problem earlier on—those insights are much easier to see visually.</p>
